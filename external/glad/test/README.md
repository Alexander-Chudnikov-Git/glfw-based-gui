Test
====

This directory contains integration tests ran by the [`/utility/test.sh`](../utility/test.sh) script.
These tests are mainly for testing the generators.


## Execution

There are a few requirements for actually running the test suite:

 * Linux
 * Python environment
 * GCC
 * glfw
 * mingw
 * wine

Depending on future generators being added there may be more.
